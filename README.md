# Performance analysis and optimization of Python's cyclic GC in Deep Learning training
In this repo, we will develop experiments to analyze Python's cyclic garbage collector performance when running Deep Learning (DL) model training workloads in PyTorch. We will research garbage collection algorithms and optimization techniques that can improve performance in the training process of different DL architectures. The project will apply GC configurations and validate their impact by benchmarking and profiling sample DL model training with optimized versus unoptimized configurations. Based on the experimental results, we will quantify garbage collection bottlenecks in training and provide architecture-based guidelines to optimize Python garbage collection for users building and training DL models.
